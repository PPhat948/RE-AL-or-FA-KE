# RE-AL or FA-KE

RE-AL or FA-KE is a project designed to classify real artwork created by humans and AI-generated images using deep learning techniques. 
It involves developing models based on CNN and transfer learning techniques using ResNet, MobileNetV2, and VGG19, followed by a comparison of their performance 
results. A web application built with Streamlit allows users to upload images and receive classification results.
